Sigla is your personal nutrition tracker for your kids, so you can keep them healthy, growing, and energetic. As all kids should be.


## Features
1. **One-stop BMI + Calorie Calculator** - Input some simple details, and let us do the rest. Have your kid's needed daily calories in a snap using Sigla's algorithm.

2. **Breakdown of needed calories** - Get a detailed breakdown of said calorie count, from ounces of proteins to cups of vegetables, all the way down to that last grain of rice.

3. **Food database** - Know what you need to buy, before you even buy it. Our database provides you with the right choices that'll fill the stomach, but not empty the wallet.
